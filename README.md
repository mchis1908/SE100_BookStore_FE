# Introduce
The bookstore management system is built to support managers in tasks related to the operation and management of bookstores, including activities related to books such as searching, looking up, and managing relevant information. It also encompasses tasks related to facilities and finances, such as income and expenses, profit, facility status, shelf positions, and inventory. For customers, the application facilitates easy book selection, information retrieval, and seamless book transactions.

A basic bookstore may manage a large number of different titles with a substantial total quantity. As the system targets stores of moderate to large scale, the volume of customers served is expected to be significant. The store will operate on all days of the week, including Sundays and holidays, with specified opening and closing hours. Key responsibilities include managing purchases, sales, staff, customer transactions, shelf arrangements, handling and resolving issues within the bookstore. Additionally, the store will regularly acquire and dispose of books.

The system is designed for use in bookstores equipped with tablets scattered throughout the store. Customers can browse information about books in the library, add items to their shopping cart, and then proceed to pay at the counter.

The management system will include three user levels: the store owner (admin) will have the highest level of access and control over the store's data, including information about employees and customers. The second level is for employees (employee), similar to the admin level but with restricted access and rights, such as the inability to modify employee database information. This level allows employees to update data on books and handle daily operational and business tasks. The third level is for customers (customer), where access is limited to publicly available store information. Customers can search for basic book information (title, price, author, publisher, etc.) and library details. Customers at this level do not need to log in to the system.
